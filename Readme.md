# Time App
## Current Release v0.4
---
This is a collection of timing apps that can be used to aid presenters. Designed to run full screen on a web browser and displayed on a downstage monitor. These are writen in basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that they can easily be run without any additional tools/software installed. You can also use them on or off-line. They have been optimized to run on displays that are 1920x1080.
